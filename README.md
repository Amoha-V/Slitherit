# Slither Game

Slither is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The objective of the game is to become the longest snake on the board while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Features

1. **Snake Movement**: The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys or WASD keys. The snake will move continuously, and the player can change its direction to navigate the game board.
2. **Food Generation**: The game randomly generates food items on the board, which the snake can eat to grow longer.
3. **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the snake eats more food.
4. **High Score**: The game stores the player's high score, which is displayed on the screen.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Upon game over, the player can restart the game.
6. **Sound Effects**: The game includes sound effects for the snake's movement, food consumption, and game over.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the game's user interface and display the game board.
